## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[I haven't used any outside resource]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[I have run into a few issues. At first I was having trouble making the sound. I read in the reading that in order to generate the beep sound, my sound would not function. That was a result of my changing the "Btn" to the "Button," which gave me trouble. However, it took me almost two hours to realize it and after I changed it, it functioned. To understand what was happening, I had to go back and read the entire game manuscript on the codepath link that was provided. Another issue I ran across was that the display that tells you if you won the game or not always appeared at the top of the pageI tried to make it to the the middle, but I was unable to do so. At first, I assumed there would be a CSS issue, but there isn't a win or lose function in CSS. Later, I noticed that although my win and lose functions are written in JavaScript, they have no mention of the location of the the display that tells you if you won the game or not. I just left everything as is because I don't really know someone who is good in HTML, CSS, or JavaScript who I could ask for assistance from or just some insight into. However, it seems to me that it is simply positioning and has no important impact on the game. ]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[How can I tell whether an issue is with JavaScript, HTML, or CSS? I am know that they all work and perform differently, yet when it comes to making a website or game, they are all related. I encountered a problem with one of my codes, which I was able to solve, but I had to go back and review the entire code to see where the issue began. It's easier to move forward after you figure it out, or you at least make progress. However, that is one question I have. Are there any shortcuts or simpler ways to tell the difference between them?]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[If I had more time, I would have added a section where you could try again if you miss your first attempt. I would also have made things simpler by adding a large clock at the bottom that could signal to the user that they have ten seconds to guess every function correctly when the computer has finished playing the sequence. And when they make mistakes, that's when the life factor kicks in and allows them another shot at that particular level. That would, in my opinion, make the game more engaging and enjoyable. I would also need to teach myself how to do that.]
